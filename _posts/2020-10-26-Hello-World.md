## My Trip to the American Historical Society Annual Conference ##

In January 2023, I had the honor of presenting a poster at the American Historical Association’s Annual Conference in Philadelphia. Over the summer of 2022, I was able to access Harvard’s Schlesinger Library Archives to gain important experience in primary source and archival research, which has informed a paper that my poster is based off of. Access to these sources has allowed me to explore an era of the National Organization for Women, a mainstream feminist organization that was founded in the 1960s, which has been previously unexplored by other scholars. I was able to explore the organization’s work on lesbian rights in the 1980s, and compare it to their work with lesbian rights in the 1970s which has been covered widely by scholars. My paper and poster argue that the issue of lesbian rights was not settled in NOW in the 1970s, and the 1980s requires significant examination of the continuity and changes of controversy and work in lesbian rights in NOW which reflected NOW’s trademark controversies over feminist fears of the rhetoric of the religious right wing and wider debates within feminism.
